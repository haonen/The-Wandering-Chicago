## Project Overview
---
> Final Project for CAPP30122 Computer Science with Applications II (Winter 2019)
> 
> Ta-Yun Yang, Xuan Bu, Yuwei Zhang

> Many cities in the U.S. spare no efforts to handle the issue of homelessness by providing a variety of relevant services, including Chicago. However, information of those services is scattered among governmental departments, private agencies(eg. charity churches), and web mapping provider (eg. Google). To maximize the effects of existing services and technologies, our project focuses on narrowing the informational gap between homeless people and service providers.
>
> We aim to develop a recommendation system which is used to integrate accessible resources for homeless residents in Chicago. By collecting data from portal websites, using Google Map API and computing distance based on haversine formula, our software is capable of recommending nearest facilities. According to the Homeless Point-in-Time Count & Survey Report (Nathalie P. Voorhees Center, 2018), we particularly include the categories of shelters, food pantries, health services and warming/cooling centers. Meanwhile, homeless people with specific needs of family support can also find pertinent information in our system.
>
> The target users of the system will not be restricted to the homeless. It could also be adopted by the governmental service providers, charities and institutions who have access to the contact and geographical information of the homeless.

## Pipelines
---
> ###### The pipeline contains five python files:
> * <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> find_facilities.py: </span> impletements the recommendation alogrithm with the processed data; and generate a web page representing the qualified facilities and their corresponding locations on Google Map
> * <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> util.py: </span> contains the helper functions for crawl_food_pantry.py, crawl_shelter.py and find_facilities.py
> * <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> crawl_food_pantry.py: </span> scrapes the website of food pantries
> * <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> crawl_shelter.py: </span> scrapes the website of shelters
> * <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> data_cleaning.py: </span> cleans the raw data from Chicago Data Portal
> 
> ###### Before executing the following code in User Guide, please import <span style="background-color: #edeeef"> find_facilities.py</span>:
```python 3
import find_facilities
```

> ###### In the following cases, we use the merged data of facilities provided in the file and specify address of John Crerar Library at the University of Chicago as an example. Note that if you download the data set in a different folder, please include the full path here. And address can be explicit or implicit as long as it can be identified by Google Map.
```python 3
filename = "full_data.csv"
address = "5730 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637"
